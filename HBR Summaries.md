# Creating a Personal Value Proposition: (https://hbr.org/2011/11/a-value-proposition-for-your-c)

## 1. Set a clear target. 

The PVP begins with a target, one that needs what you have to offer. You’ll prefer some directions, not others. 
Targeting will make you most effective. 

## 2. Identify your strengths. It may sound obvious, but what you know and 

what you can do are the foundation of your PVP. Hone in on what those are.


## 3. Tie your strengths to your target position. 

Don’t leave it up to the employer to figure out how your strengths 
relate to what she needs. Let your PVP tightly connect you to the position. Connect the dots for her. Consider 
her perspective and know why she should hire you or promote you.

## 4. Provide evidence and success stories. 

Your strengths may be what an employer is “buying,” but your achievements 
are the evidence you have those strengths. They make your case convincing. Some people prepare a non-confidential 
portfolio to showcase that evidence in a vivid way. They collect reports they wrote that had impact. They pull together 
facts on measurable achievements such as sales growth or cost reduction.
