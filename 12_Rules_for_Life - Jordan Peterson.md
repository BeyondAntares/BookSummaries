# Jordan Peterson - 12 Rules for Life and an Antidote for Chaos

**Rule 1: Stand up straight with your shoulders back.**

Be confident and be the best version of yourself, physically, mentally, emptionally. This is how you attract a mate who will feel lucky to have someone like you.

*Key take aways:*
1. We reach fullfillment by pursuing meaning in our lives
2. In order to fulfill meaning we need to constantly keep trying to be the best versions of ourselves.
3. Depression can cause people to not feel wanted or needed by a crowd and cause them to drift away. The isolation itself can exacerbate the same feelings causing a greater sense of depression. 
4. Children experience bullying because they can't fight back. It can happen because they are weaker, "The toughest of 6 year olds are no match for someone who's 9". We get over these in adulthood and measures are put in place to to limit these. 
5. People who have decided all forms of aggression are morally wrong and are therefore more sensitive to acute senses of tyranny - due to strong and controlling father figures. 
6. You need to state no early in the cycle of oppression and stand by your terms can reduce the extent of the oppression.  
7. Those that are naive and easily exploitable cannot stand up for themselves, due to an inability to rise up against the imbalance of power. 
8. People with naive beliefs are prone to harm by those that prey on such behaviors. 
9. PTSD isn't witnessing wrong but partaking in it and realizing they to have the capacity to become the monster they fear themselves. 
10. People that are hyper sheltered will be shocked the most when facing such difficult 
11. If you are a loser, you don't have to continue in that mode. You could be a collection of bad habits. Circumstances change. If you appear as a defeated lobster, people will treat you like one. People will treat you poorly because you can't stand up for yourself. Whereas if you exude confidence or a winning mindset, you will attract better treatment from those around you. 
12. Standing up - voluntarily accepting the burden of being, physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. Standing up for yourself, being the best that you can be. Being better and meaningful than who you were yesterday. Speak your mind, be heard and win the right to your thoughts and opinions. People will start to assume you are confident and able. 


**Rule 2: treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping**
* people are unsettled by their vulnerabilities eternally fear to tell the truth to mediate between chaos and order and manifest their destiny. 

* Carl Jung - treat others as you would like to be treated is not about being nice. It is not virtuous to be victimized by a bully even if its yourself. Morally obliged to bargain on my behalf as they are to themselves. Or else we accept being a slave. Embracing and loving the sinner who is ourselves. 

* Your mistreatment of yourself hurts others more than yourself. Aftermath of suicide hurts others for many years. 

* most individuals are dealing with multiple problems, yet people prevail and keep up an image that everything is fine. 

* wounded people are the best at holding it together during tough life struggles. People are so tortured for being.  Ongoing miracle of fortitude and perseverence.

* He points out a universal tendency to not treat ourselves the way we treat others we are responsible for. 

* we deserve some resepct, you deserve some respect, you are important to other people as much as yourself. You are morally obliged to be there for others and yourself.  

* happy != good. Giving kids candy to be happy doesnt make you a good parent, but against their will to look after their own well being, such as wearing snow coats or brushing their teeth. Your responsibility is to raise them to be morally contributing members of society because you owe it to yourself and others around us. 

* heaven does not come easy
* dont underestimate the power of vision and direction, able to tranform unconquearble obstacles into traversable pathways and expanding opportunties. 
* strengthen the individual and choose your destination, articulating your behaviour
* Nietze : he who's life has a why, can bare any how.
* Begin by treating yourself as someone you are responsible for helping. 

**Rule 3: Make friends with people who want the best for you.**
* Down is easier than up
* Why try to save others? Is it easier to look virtuous against them? 
* Are you enabling contempt? Or associating with people that are bad for you indirectly brings you down. 
* Before help someone, ask yourself what they did to go down that path. 
* Failure is easier to understand. Fear hatred deception promiscuity doesnt require exolanation. Vice is easy and so is failure. 
* Maybe misery is your response to watching everyone around you moving onwards and upwards. 
* Its impossible to help someone who didnt want to improve. It only works when someone is forced to seek it. 


**Rule 4: Compare yourself to who you were yesterday not to who someone else is today.**

**Rule 5: Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them.**

**Rule 6. Set your house in perfect order before you criticise the world**

**Rule 7. Pursue what is meaningful not what is expedient.**

**Rule 8: Tell the truth or at least don’t lie**

**Rule 9: Assume the person you are listening to might know something you don’t**

**Rule 10: Be precise in your speech**

**Rule 11: Do not bother children when they are skateboarding.**

**Rule 12: Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street.**
