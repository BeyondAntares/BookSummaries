# Jordan Peterson - 12 Rules for Life and an Antidote for Chaos

**Rule 1: Stand up straight with your shoulders back.**

Be confident and be the best version of yourself, physically, mentally, emptionally. This is how you attract a mate who will feel lucky to have someone like you.

*Key take aways:*
1. We reach fullfillment by pursuing meaning in our lives
2. In order to fulfill meaning we need to constantly keep trying to be the best versions of ourselves.
3. Depression can cause people to not feel wanted or needed by a crowd and cause them to drift away. The isolation itself can exacerbate the same feelings causing a greater sense of depression. 
4. Children experience bullying because they can't fight back. It can happen because they are weaker, "The toughest of 6 year olds are no match for someone who's 9". We get over these in adulthood and measures are put in place to to limit these. 
5. People who have decided all forms of aggression are morally wrong and are therefore more sensitive to acute senses of tyranny - due to strong and controlling father figures. 
6. You need to state no early in the cycle of oppression and stand by your terms can reduce the extent of the oppression.  
7. Those that are naive and easily exploitable cannot stand up for themselves, due to an inability to rise up against the imbalance of power. 
8. People with naive beliefs are prone to harm by those that prey on such behaviors. 
9. PTSD isn't witnessing wrong but partaking in it and realizing they to have the capacity to become the monster they fear themselves. 
10. People that are hyper sheltered will be shocked the most when facing such difficult 
11. If you are a loser, you don't have to continue in that mode. You could be a collection of bad habits. Circumstances change. If you appear as a defeated lobster, people will treat you like one. People will treat you poorly because you can't stand up for yourself. Whereas if you exude confidence or a winning mindset, you will attract better treatment from those around you. 
12. Standing up - voluntarily accepting the burden of being, physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. Standing up for yourself, being the best that you can be. Being better and meaningful than who you were yesterday. Speak your mind, be heard and win the right to your thoughts and opinions. People will start to assume you are confident and able. 


**Rule 2: treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping**

**Rule 3: Make friends with people who want the best for you.**

**Rule 4: Compare yourself to who you were yesterday not to who someone else is today.**

**Rule 5: Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them.**

**Rule 6. Set your house in perfect order before you criticise the world**

**Rule 7. Pursue what is meaningful not what is expedient.**

**Rule 8: Tell the truth or at least don’t lie**

**Rule 9: Assume the person you are listening to might know something you don’t**

**Rule 10: Be precise in your speech**

**Rule 11: Do not bother children when they are skateboarding.**

**Rule 12: Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street.**
