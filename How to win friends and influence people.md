**On criticism**

* Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person’s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment. …. Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain—and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.

* That reminds me of this famous quote by Thomas Carlyle: “A great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men.”

**On dealing with people**

* When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.

**On influence**

* The only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.

**On the secret of success**

* If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.
